Today day marks the launch of this amazing project. With the help of open-source tools and the open-source community, I want to create a new domain under which talented developers, makers, tinkerers or hackers come together to share and develop resources and give other people the opportunity to access computer cluster solutions in a low-cost way.

If you like the outline of this project and want to see it grow, please join our facebook group and star our Github project.
