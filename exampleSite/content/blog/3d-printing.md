Herewith I'm presenting you the worlds most compact, fully 3D-printable, ARM-based single-board computer cluster case.
You might ask yourself:

**Why ARM-based single-board computers?**   
Because they are cheap in acquisition costs and cheap in operational expenses. Furthermore they allow a lot of parallelization, when used as a cluster. Imagine a cluster of eight boards, with every board being as powerful as a modern smartphone. That's a lot of computational power working in a symphony.

And it gets even better. Because this case supports various types of credit card-sized single-board computers, such as

-  [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) or
-  [Rock64](https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/)

it offers the assembly for custom cost-tiers. You choose the performance that suits your budget. Chances of turning the the cluster into cash in the end are good, Raspberry Pis and other SBCs are popular and somehow stable in price!

**Why 3D-printing?**   
Because it is a fully automated and repeatable process. All you need is one 3D-design, and one 3D-printer machine and a decent amount of bio-plastics and you can reproduce the design as many times as your inventory of bio-plastics allow you to.

Isn't that convincing enough? Well I believe so, and that's why I invested into designing this compact cluster of single-board computers. Check it out by clicking the button:
